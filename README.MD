# OwnYourCam :sunglasses: :video_camera:

Own your cam is a crossplatform, open source, lightweight tool for you to protect your privacy against the growing landscape of video conferencing tools.

It serves as a virtual filter between your camera and the video software which uses your camera, to remove the control from the video conferencing software over your webcam.

Features:

* Simple to use

* Create a virtual webcam to share with the video conferencing tool you are using

* Digital interface to control/deactivate your virtual camera.

* Background recognition, which enables you to switch out your background for your virtual camera.

This project was created during the #EUVsVirus Hackathon. It tackles privacy concerning side effects of the growing usage of video conferencing tools.
